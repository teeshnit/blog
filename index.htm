<h1>What are the main financial issues facing young people today, and what might some of the answers be?</h1>

<p>Children are well known for their big dreams. “When I grow up, I’m going to be a billionaire,” they often squeak. Although most are sobered eventually, you would at the very least hope that they were less financially burdened than the generations that came before them. Alas, reality is not so for the vast majority of young people.</p>

<p>Generally, the most important purchase one makes is a home. Home ownership can provide tax exemptions and a value-appreciating asset, improving purchasing power. Young people have not been afforded this privilege. According to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, only 27% of young adults earning middle incomes owned their own home in 2016, compared to the 65% figure for 1996. What could explain such a drastic drop in such a short time? Well, the IFS claim that although real incomes grew by 22%, average house prices exploded, growing by 152% in the same period.  This divergence is even more pronounced in Greater London and the South East, regions numerous young adults, including myself, call home. </p> 
  
<p>So what? Perhaps reduced home ownership is not so bad. Perhaps millennials don’t see it as a good investment. For instance, if more are choosing renting as an alternative, labour mobility increases. This can be vital in a world of freelancing and short-term contracts. But the data shows otherwise. Over two-thirds of 16 to 29-year olds in the EU were living with their parents in 2017,  suggesting that most are not even well-off enough to rent. </p>
  
<p>Millennials have also seemed to forgo investing in general, after seeing how the 2008 recession wiped out their parents’ investments.  It could also be theorised that instant gratification has been ingrained in our psychologies as a result of social media and technology, and impatience is preventing Generation Y from seeing investments to fruition. The world is ever more complex too- Junior ISAs, mutual funds, fixed-rate government bonds, cryptocurrencies. It is easy to be overwhelmed to the point of being scared off investing altogether.      </p>
  
<p>   Forget making more through investing- young people are first trying to free themselves from the student debt they start their careers with. Primarily because of slashes to the government’s education budget, tuition fees for higher education have skyrocketed. The House of Commons Library states that the average debt among borrowers who finished their courses in 2018 was £36,000, with only 30% expected to repay their loans in full.  Even worse is an overdraft or credit card debt. YouGov surveys demonstrate that young people struggle with this too.  These are considered ‘bad debts’, as they are usually high interest and don’t generate income or appreciate in value. This problem is exacerbated due to the modern world- cashless payments have been shown to increase spending relative to their traditional counterparts.  Not physically seeing the transfer of money seems to cause you to lose track of how much you’re spending, increasing the likelihood of debt. </p>  
  
<p>Luckily, technology strives to amend the problems it has created. Apple Pay and online banks like Monzo have user-friendly features that allow you to track your cashless spending by category. Young people should be utilising these to retain a grip on their finances. </p>  
  
<p>Furthermore, their outlook towards investing needs to change. Investing need not be so intimidating- it is no longer reserved for fat cats in flashy suits. Again, fintech has lent a helping hand; in the USA, Acorns is an app that rounds up purchases made with a linked debit card to the nearest dollar. The change is then automatically invested into a portfolio. Users can even select the composition of the portfolio based on how risk-averse they are. With over 3.5 million users, they are one of the companies that have made investing accessible for the masses.     </p>  
  
<p>As for the housing crisis, the solution is trickier, and certain to be politically controversial. Young, first time home buyers have already been assisted by the government’s Help to Buy Scheme. This should be continued and strengthened, as should government projects to build more affordable housing.  It is estimated that a minimum of 300,000 homes be built per year to address the supply shortage in the UK housing market.  Another way to help solve the housing crisis in larger cities is to stop new projects from being bought solely by investors. Instead, a mixture of first time and buy-to-let buyers would better solve the demand surplus. This way, people who actually need property can get it, as opposed to affluent multinationals, who are notorious for leaving their purchases empty for most of the year anyway. </p>  
  
<p>It appears that both public and private sectors are trying to fix the woes of young people. They must both continue to sever the chains holding down our youth, in order to allow them to build a better future.</p>
